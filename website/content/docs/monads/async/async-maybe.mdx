# AsyncMaybe Monad

Async version of the Maybe monad for operations that might not return a value.

---

## Overview

```python
from better_py import AsyncMaybe

async def fetch_user(id: int) -> AsyncMaybe[User]:
    user = await db.find(id)
    return AsyncMaybe.from_value(user)
```

---

## Creating AsyncMaybe

### AsyncMaybe.some()

```python
AsyncMaybe.some(value)
```

### AsyncMaybe.nothing()

```python
AsyncMaybe.nothing()
```

### AsyncMaybe.from_value()

```python
AsyncMaybe.from_value(await fetch_user(id))
```

---

## Transforming AsyncMaybe

### map()

```python
(await fetch_user(id)).map(lambda u: u.name)
```

### bind()

```python
(await fetch_user(id)).bind(lambda u: fetch_profile(u.id))
```

---

## Real-World Example

```python
from better_py import AsyncMaybe

async def get_user_email(user_id: int) -> AsyncMaybe[str]:
    return (
        AsyncMaybe.from_value(await db.find_user(user_id))
        .map(lambda user: user.email)
    )

email = await get_user_email(123)
# AsyncMaybe.some("user@example.com") or AsyncMaybe.nothing()
```
