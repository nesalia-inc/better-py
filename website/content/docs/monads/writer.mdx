description: Computations with logging/output
---

# Writer Monad

The `Writer` monad represents a computation that produces a value along with a log or output.

---

## Overview

```python
from better_py import Writer

# Create a writer with a log
writer = Writer(["Processing..."], 42)
```

<Callout type="success" title="When to Use Writer">

-  Audit logging
-  Debugging computations
-  Building output alongside computation

</Callout>

---

## Creating Writer Values

### Writer()

Create with log and value:

```python
from better_py import Writer

writer = Writer(["Step 1", "Step 2"], "result")
```

### Helper constructors

```python
from better_py import Writer

# For list logs
Writer.list_writer(["Log"], value)

# For string logs  
Writer.str_writer("Log", value)

# For numeric logs
Writer.sum_writer(1, value)
```

---

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Audit Trail

```python
from better_py import Writer

def transfer(amount: float, from_acc: Account, to_acc: Account) -> Writer[list[str], Transaction]:
    return (
        Writer([], None)
        .tap(lambda _: [f"Transferring {amount} from {from_acc.id} to {to_acc.id}"])
        .map(lambda _: from_acc.debit(amount))
        .tap(lambda _: [f"Debited {amount} from {from_acc.id}"])
        .bind(lambda new_from: to_acc.credit(amount).map(lambda new_to: (new_from, new_to)))
    )

logs, transaction = transfer(100, acc1, acc2).run()
# logs = [
#   "Transferring 100 from acc1 to acc2",
#   "Debited 100 from acc1"
# ]
```
