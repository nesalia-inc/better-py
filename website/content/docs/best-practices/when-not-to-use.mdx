title: When Not to Use Functional Programming
description: Situations where FP might not be the best choice
---

Functional programming is great, but not always the best tool.

## When to Avoid FP

### 1. Simple Scripts

```python
# For simple one-off scripts, regular Python is fine
def main():
    data = load_data()
    process(data)
    save(data)
```

### 2. Performance-Critical Loops

```python
# For tight loops, regular Python might be faster
for i in range(1000000):
    process(i)
```

### 3. interfacing with Mutable APIs

```python
# When working with mutable libraries, just use them directly
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

## Guidelines

- Use FP for business logic, data pipelines, error handling
- Use regular Python for simple scripts, performance code, I/O heavy operations
