# Testing Functional Code

Pure functions make testing easy.

## Unit Tests

```python
def test_maybe_map():
    result = Maybe.some(5).map(lambda x: x * 2)
    assert result == Maybe.some(10)
```

## Property-Based Tests

```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.integers())
def test_maybe_map_identity(x):
    result = Maybe.some(x).map(lambda x: x)
    assert result == Maybe.some(x)
```
