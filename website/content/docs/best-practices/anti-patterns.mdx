Common mistakes and how to avoid them.

## Anti-Patterns

### 1. Ignoring None

```python
# Bad
value = Maybe.some(42)
result = value.unwrap()  # Might crash!

# Good
value = Maybe.some(42)
result = value.unwrap_or(0)
```

### 2. Nesting Monads

```python
# Bad
maybe_maybe = Maybe.some(Maybe.some(42))

# Good
maybe = Maybe.some(42)
```

### 3. Mixing Errors and Exceptions

```python
# Bad: Inconsistent
def sometimes_raises():
    if condition:
        raise ValueError("Bad")
    return Result.error("Also bad")

# Good: Consistent
def always_result():
    if condition:
        return Result.error("Bad")
    return Result.ok(value)
```
