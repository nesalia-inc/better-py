# What is better-py?

better-py is a **pragmatic, type-safe functional programming library for Python** that brings functional programming concepts to Python in a way that feels natural and idiomatic.

## Philosophy

better-py is built on the principle of **"Functional Entities as Objects"**. Instead of using standalone functions, we represent functional concepts as objects with methods. This approach:

- **Feels natural to Python developers** - Works like the Python objects you already know
- **Enables method chaining** - Write expressive code like `value.map().filter().reduce()`
- **Provides full type safety** - Complete generic type tracking with mypy support
- **Maintains immutability** - All operations return new instances

## Core Principles

### 1. Objects, Not Functions

Unlike traditional functional programming libraries that use functions, better-py uses objects:

```python
# Traditional functional style (not better-py)
map(lambda x: x * 2, filter(lambda x: x > 0, values))

# better-py style
Some(42).map(lambda x: x * 2)
```

### 2. Protocol-Based Design

better-py uses Python's `typing.Protocol` for structural typing. Classes can implement functional behaviors by adhering to protocols, without rigid inheritance hierarchies.

### 3. Type Safety

Every operation preserves type information through generic type parameters:

```python
from better_py import Some

value: Some[int] = Some(42)
doubled: Some[int] = value.map(lambda x: x * 2)  # Type: Some[int]
```

### 4. Immutability

All entities are frozen dataclasses. Operations return new instances:

```python
original = Some(42)
modified = original.map(lambda x: x * 2)

# original is still Some(42)
# modified is Some(84)
```

## What's Included

### Monads

- **Maybe[T]** - Handle optional values (`Some(value)` or `Nothing`)
- **Result[T, E]** - Explicit error handling (`Ok(value)` or `Error(error)`)
- **Either[L, R]** - Two-value alternatives (`Left` or `Right`)
- **Validation[T, E]** - Accumulate validation errors (`Valid` or `Invalid`)
- **IO** - Delay side effects
- **Reader** - Dependency injection
- **Writer** - Logging and accumulation
- **State** - State threading
- **Try** - Exception handling as values

### Protocols

- **Mappable** - Functor-like map operations
- **Reducible** - Fold/reduce operations
- **Combinable** - Monoid combine operations
- **Traversable** - Sequence operations
- **Updatable** - Immutable updates

### Collections

- **PersistentList** - Immutable linked list with structural sharing
- **PersistentMap** - Immutable dictionary
- **PersistentSet** - Immutable set

### Utilities

- **pipe** - Left-to-right function composition
- **compose** - Right-to-left function composition
- **curry** - Partial application
- **partial_right** - Right-side partial application

## Who Should Use better-py?

better-py is ideal for Python developers who want to:

- **Write more robust code** with explicit error handling
- **Eliminate null/None errors** with Maybe
- **Compose operations** cleanly with method chaining
- **Maintain type safety** with full mypy support
- **Learn functional programming** in a Pythonic way

## What better-py is NOT

- ❌ Not a framework - It's a library you can use anywhere
- ❌ Not academic - Avoids confusing terminology, focuses on practicality
- ❌ Not opinionated - Use what you need, ignore what you don't
- ❌ Not incompatible - Works well with existing Python code

## Design Goals

1. **Pragmatic over pure** - Real-world utility over theoretical correctness
2. **Pythonic over academic** - Natural Python style over functional purism
3. **Type-safe over dynamic** - Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
4. **Simple over clever** - Clear code over clever abstractions
