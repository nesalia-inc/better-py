# Migration Guide

Migrate from other functional programming libraries to better-py.

## From returns

```python
# returns
from returns import Maybe, Result

# better-py
from better_py import Maybe, Result

# Similar API
Maybe.some(42)
Result.ok(42)
```

## From toolz

```python
# toolz
from toolz import pipe, compose

# better-py
from better_py import pipe, compose

# Same usage
pipe(data, transform, save)
```

## From fn.py

```python
# fn.py
from fn.op import curried

# better-py
from better_py import curry

# Similar usage
@curry
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```
