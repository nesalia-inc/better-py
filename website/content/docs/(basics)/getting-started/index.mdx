## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed on your system. better-py uses modern Python features like generic type syntax (`list[T]` instead of `List[T]`), self types, and advanced typing features that were introduced in Python 3.11.

You will also need a code editor. VS Code or PyCharm are recommended because they provide excellent Python support with type checking and autocomplete. Finally, you should have basic Python knowledge and be comfortable with classes and type hints.

<Callout type="info" title="Why Python 3.11 or higher?">

better-py relies on modern Python typing features for full type safety. The library uses generic type syntax, self types, and other improvements that make the type system more expressive and the code more reliable.

## Installation

Installing better-py is straightforward. Choose the package manager that fits your workflow.

### Using pip

pip is the standard Python package manager and works everywhere:

```bash
pip install better-py-fp
```

### Using uv (recommended)

uv is a fast Python package manager and resolver:

```bash
uv pip install better-py-fp
```

### Using Poetry

Poetry is a modern dependency management tool for Python:

```bash
poetry add better-py-fp
```

### Using pipenv

pipenv combines pip and virtualenv in a single tool:

```bash
pipenv install better-py-fp
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Package Name Note">

The PyPI package name is `better-py-fp`, but you import it in your code as `better_py`:

```python
from better_py import Maybe, Result
```

This naming convention avoids conflicts with other packages while keeping the import name clean and intuitive.

## Verify Your Installation

After installing, create a simple test script to verify everything works correctly:

```python
# test_better_py.py
from better_py import Maybe, Result

# Test Maybe
maybe = Maybe.some(42)
print(f"Maybe: {maybe}")
print(f"Is some: {maybe.is_some()}")
print(f"Value: {maybe.unwrap()}")

# Test Result
result = Result.ok("Hello, better-py!")
print(f"Result: {result}")
print(f"Is ok: {result.is_ok()}")

print("\nbetter-py is working!")
```

Run the script:

```bash
python test_better_py.py
```

You should see output confirming that better-py is installed and functioning correctly:

```
Maybe: Some(42)
Is some: True
Value: 42
Result: Ok('Hello, better-py!')
Is ok: True

better-py is working!
```

## Editor Setup

Setting up your editor properly will give you the best experience with better-py. The library relies heavily on type hints, so good IDE support for type checking and autocomplete is essential.

### VS Code

Install these extensions for optimal development experience:

1. **Python** by Microsoft - Provides Python language support
2. **Pylance** - Fast type checking and autocomplete
3. **Ruff** - Fast Python linter and formatter (optional but recommended)

Configure your workspace in `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": ".venv/bin/python",
  "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic",
  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "[python]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.fixAll.ruff": "explicit"
    }
  }
}
```

### PyCharm

PyCharm has excellent Python support built-in. Enable these settings:

1. Enable type checking by going to Settings → Tools → External Tools and adding mypy
2. Enable PEP 8 compliance at Settings → Editor → Inspections → Python → PEP 8
3. Configure type checking mode to "basic" or "strict" depending on your preference

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation, here are solutions to common problems.

### Import Error

If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'better_py'`, first verify your Python version is 3.11 or higher:

```bash
python --version
```

Then check if better-py is installed:

```bash
pip list | grep better-py
```

If it's not listed, reinstall the package:

```bash
pip uninstall better-py-fp
pip install better-py-fp
```

### Type Checking Issues

If mypy shows type checking errors, ensure you're using mypy version 1.0 or higher:

```bash
pip install --upgrade mypy
```

For stricter type checking, you can run mypy in strict mode:

```bash
mypy --strict your_file.py
```

However, strict mode is optional and better-py works fine with basic type checking enabled.
