# Getting Started with better-py

Welcome! This guide will help you get started with better-py, from installation to your first functional program.

<Callout type="info" title="Learning Path">

**1. Install better-py** - Choose your preferred package manager and install better-py

**2. Learn the basics** - Understand core functional programming concepts

**3. Build something** - Follow our quick start guide to build your first project

</Callout>

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.11 or higher** - better-py uses modern Python features
- **A code editor** - VS Code or PyCharm recommended
- **Basic Python knowledge** - Familiarity with classes and types

<Callout type="info" title="Why Python 3.11+?">

better-py uses modern Python features like:
- Generic type syntax (`list[T]` instead of `List[T]`)
- Self types
- Advanced typing features
- Performance improvements

</Callout>

## Quick Installation

Choose your preferred package manager:

### Using pip

```bash
pip install better-py-fp
```

### Using uv (recommended)

```bash
uv pip install better-py-fp
```

### Using poetry

```bash
poetry add better-py-fp
```

### Using pipenv

```bash
pipenv install better-py-fp
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Package Name">

The PyPI package name is `better-py-fp`, but you import it as `better_py`:

```python
from better_py import Maybe, Result
```

This naming avoids conflicts with other packages.
</Callout>

---

## Verify Installation

Create a test script to verify your installation:

```python
# test_better_py.py
from better_py import Maybe, Result

# Test Maybe
maybe = Maybe.some(42)
print(f"Maybe: {maybe}")
print(f"Is some: {maybe.is_some()}")
print(f"Value: {maybe.unwrap()}")

# Test Result
result = Result.ok("Hello, better-py!")
print(f"Result: {result}")
print(f"Is ok: {result.is_ok()}")

print("\n better-py is working!")
```

Run it:

```bash
python test_better_py.py
```

You should see:

```
Maybe: Some(42)
Is some: True
Value: 42
Result: Ok('Hello, better-py!')
Is ok: True

 better-py is working!
```

## Editor Setup

### VS Code

Install these extensions for the best experience:

1. **Python** by Microsoft - Python language support
2. **Pylance** - Type checking and autocomplete
3. **Ruff** - Fast Python linter (optional)

Configure your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": ".venv/bin/python",
  "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic",
  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "[python]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.fixAll.ruff": "explicit"
    }
  }
}
```

### PyCharm

1. Enable **Type Checking**:
   - Settings → Tools → External Tools
   - Add mypy as an external tool

2. Enable **PEP 8 compliance**:
   - Settings → Editor → Inspections → Python → PEP 8

## Troubleshooting

### Import Error

If you get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'better_py'`:

1. **Check Python version**
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should be 3.11+
   ```

2. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   pip list | grep better-py
   ```

3. **Reinstall if needed**
   ```bash
   pip uninstall better-py-fp
   pip install better-py-fp
   ```

### Type Checking Issues

If mypy shows errors:

1. **Ensure you're using mypy 1.0+**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade mypy
   ```

2. **Use strict mode (optional)**
   ```bash
   mypy --strict your_file.py
   ```
