title: Editor Setup
description: Configure your IDE for the best better-py development experience
---

Configure your editor for the best development experience with better-py. While the library works perfectly with any text editor, setting up proper tooling will catch errors early, provide intelligent autocomplete, and make writing code more pleasant.

---

## Why Editor Configuration Matters

better-py relies heavily on Python's type system to provide safety. Without proper editor configuration, you'll miss out on one of the library's biggest benefits: real-time type checking that catches bugs before you even run your code.

A well-configured editor gives you three things:

1. **Type checking** that highlights errors as you type, not just when you run tests
2. **Autocomplete** that shows you exactly which methods are available for each type
3. **Code quality tools** that maintain consistency and catch common mistakes

The upfront investment of setting up your editor pays off quickly in fewer bugs and faster development.

---

## Quick Setup Guide

better-py works excellently with Python's standard tooling ecosystem. The core tools you'll want are:

- **mypy** for static type checking
- **Ruff** for fast linting and formatting
- **Pylance or PyCharm** for editor integration

These tools are lightweight, free, and work together seamlessly. Install them once, configure your editor, and you're set.

---

## VS Code Setup

VS Code is a popular choice for Python development because it's free, extensible, and has excellent Python support through the Pylance extension.

### Installing the Required Extensions

First, install the essential extensions from the VS Code Marketplace. Open VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS), and search for:

1. **Python** by Microsoft (extension ID: `ms-python.python`)
2. **Pylance** by Microsoft (extension ID: `ms-python.vscode-pylance`)

Pylance is the language server that powers Python autocomplete, type checking, and IntelliSense in VS Code. It's what makes working with better-py pleasant by showing you exactly which methods are available and catching type errors in real-time.

For the best experience, also install these recommended extensions:

3. **Ruff** by Astral (extension ID: `astral-sh.ruff`) - Fast Python linter and formatter
4. **Error Lens** (extension ID: `usernamehw.errorlens`) - Shows errors inline with your code

### Configuring VS Code Settings

Create a `.vscode` directory in your project and add a `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  // Python interpreter
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": ".venv/bin/python",

  // Type checking with Pylance
  "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic",
  "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["./"],

  // Auto-import suggestions
  "python.analysis.autoImportCompletions": true,

  // Code formatting
  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,

  // Linting with Ruff
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.ruffEnabled": true,
  "python.linting.ruffArgs": ["--extend-select", "--fix"],

  // Type checking on save (optional)
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.ruff": "explicit",
    "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
  },

  // File-specific settings
  "[python]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.fixAll.ruff": "explicit",
      "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
    }
  }
}
```

These settings configure VS Code to use the Python interpreter in your virtual environment, enable basic type checking, format code automatically when you save, and run Ruff to catch code quality issues.

### Setting Up mypy for Strict Type Checking

While Pylance provides basic type checking, mypy offers stricter validation that matches how better-py is designed. Create a `pyproject.toml` file in your project root:

```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.11"
strict = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_ignores = true
show_error_context = true
show_column_numbers = true
pretty = true

[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = "tests.*"
disallow_untyped_defs = false
```

The `strict = true` setting enables all of mypy's strict checks, which aligns with better-py's design philosophy. The override for test files relaxes checking slightly since tests often use patterns that would be too strict for production code.

### Creating Convenient Tasks

VS Code tasks let you run common operations from the command palette without leaving your editor. Create `.vscode/tasks.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Run with mypy",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "mypy",
      "args": ["${file}", "--strict"],
      "group": "build",
      "problemMatcher": []
    },
    {
      "label": "Run tests",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "pytest",
      "group": "test",
      "problemMatcher": []
    },
    {
      "label": "Format code",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "ruff",
      "args": ["format", "${file}"],
      "problemMatcher": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Now you can run these tasks by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and typing "Tasks: Run Task".

## PyCharm Setup

PyCharm is a full-featured Python IDE with excellent built-in type checking and tooling. If you prefer an all-in-one solution over assembling individual tools, PyCharm is a great choice.

### Enabling Type Checking

PyCharm includes type checking out of the box, but you'll want to configure it for the best experience with better-py.

1. Go to **Settings → Tools → External Tools**
2. Click **+** to add a new tool
3. Configure it like this:

```
Name: mypy
Program: $PyInterpreterDirectory$/mypy
Arguments: --strict $FilePath$
Working directory: $ProjectFileDir$
```

This sets up mypy as an external tool you can run from the Tools menu or with a keyboard shortcut.

### Configuring Type Inspections

PyCharm's inspections work in real-time as you type. Enable the relevant inspections:

1. Go to **Settings → Editor → Inspections**
2. Expand the **Python** section
3. Enable **Type checking** under the General tab
4. Enable **PEP 8 coding style** violations for code quality

PyCharm will now highlight type errors and style issues directly in your editor, similar to how VS Code does with Pylance.

### Setting Up Code Quality Tools

For the best experience, integrate Ruff into your PyCharm workflow:

1. Go to **Settings → Tools → External Tools**
2. Add Ruff check:

```
Name: Ruff Check
Program: ruff
Arguments: check $FilePath$ --fix
Working directory: $ProjectFileDir$
```

3. Add Ruff format:

```
Name: Ruff Format
Program: ruff
Arguments: format $FilePath$
Working directory: $ProjectFileDir$
```

Now you can run these tools from the Tools menu or assign keyboard shortcuts for quick access.

### Configuring Code Style

Set up PyCharm's code style to match Python conventions:

1. Go to **Settings → Editor → Code Style → Python**
2. Set **Indent** to 4 spaces
3. Enable **Continuation indent**
4. Go to the **Wrapping and Braces** tab
5. Set **Hard wrap at** to 100 characters

This ensures your code is formatted consistently, which is especially important when working with a team.

## Neovim Setup

If you prefer a Vim-style editor, Neovim has excellent Python support through the LSP (Language Server Protocol) ecosystem.

Here's a basic configuration using Lazy.nvim for plugin management:

```lua
-- init.lua
return {
  -- LSP configuration
  {
    'neovim/nvim-lspconfig',
    config = function()
      require('lspconfig').pylance.setup({
        settings = {
          python = {
            analysis = {
              typeCheckingMode = 'basic',
              autoImportCompletions = true,
            }
          }
        }
      })
    end
  },

  -- Completion
  {
    'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp',
    dependencies = {
      'hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp',
      'hrsh7th/cmp-buffer',
    },
  },

  -- Type checking
  {
    'mfussenegger/nvim-lint',
    config = function()
      require('lint').linters_by_ft = {
        python = { 'mypy' }
      }
    end
  },

  -- Formatting
  {
    'stevearc/conform.nvim',
    opts = {
      formatters_by_ft = {
        python = { 'ruff_format' },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

This configuration sets up Pylance for language server features, nvim-cmp for autocomplete, mypy for type checking, and Ruff for formatting. The result is a lightweight but powerful Python development environment.

## Configuring Development Tools

Regardless of which editor you choose, you'll want to configure the underlying development tools. These configurations work across all editors.

### mypy Configuration

mypy is the standard static type checker for Python. Create `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.11"
strict = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_ignores = true
warn_redundant_casts = true
warn_unreachable = true
show_error_context = true
show_column_numbers = true
show_error_codes = true
pretty = true

[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = "tests.*"
strict = false
disallow_untyped_defs = false
```

The `strict` setting enables all optional type checking features, which is what you want when working with better-py. The test file override prevents mypy from being too aggressive in test code where you might intentionally use looser types.

### Ruff Configuration

Ruff is a fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust. Add to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py311"
line-length = 100

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
  "E",   # pycodestyle errors
  "W",   # pycodestyle warnings
  "F",   # pyflakes
  "I",   # isort
  "B",   # flake8-bugbear
  "C4",  # flake8-comprehensions
  "UP",  # pyupgrade
]

[tool.ruff.format]
quote-style = "double"
indent-style = "space"
```

Ruff is significantly faster than traditional tools like Flake8 or Black, making it ideal for use in editors where you want instant feedback.

### Pytest Configuration

If you're using pytest for testing, configure it in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
pythonpath = ["."]
addopts = "-ra --strict-markers --tb=short"
markers = [
  "unit: Unit tests",
  "integration: Integration tests",
  "slow: Slow-running tests",
]
```

The `--tb=short` flag makes test output more concise by showing only relevant traceback information. The markers help you organize tests and run specific categories.

---

## Virtual Environment Setup

Always use a virtual environment for Python development. This isolates your project dependencies from system Python and other projects.

### Using venv

Python includes venv by default, so it works everywhere:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate on macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate on Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install better-py
pip install better-py-fp
```

Virtual environments are simple and require no additional tools. Use this approach if you want something that just works.

### Using uv (Recommended)

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a modern Python package manager that's much faster than pip:

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create project
uv init my-project
cd my-project

# Install better-py
uv pip install better-py-fp

# Activate shell
uv shell
```

uv manages virtual environments automatically and resolves dependencies faster than pip. It's particularly valuable in larger projects or teams where dependency management becomes complex.

## Configuring Git

A good `.gitignore` file prevents you from accidentally committing generated files, virtual environments, and editor settings.

Create `.gitignore` in your project root:

```text
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
.Python
.venv/
venv/
ENV/
env/

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
*~

# mypy
.mypy_cache/
.dmypy.json
dmypy.json

# Testing
.pytest_cache/
.coverage
htmlcov/
*.cover
.hypothesis/

# Distribution
dist/
build/
*.egg-info/
```

This keeps your repository clean by excluding files that are generated or specific to your local setup. Other team members will thank you.

---

## Verifying Your Setup

After configuring your editor, verify that everything works correctly. Create a simple test file:

```python
# test_setup.py
from better_py import Maybe, Result

# This should show no type errors
def get_value() -> Maybe[int]:
    return Maybe.some(42)

def process_result() -> Result[str, int]:
    result = get_value()
    if result.is_some():
        value = result.unwrap()
        return Result.ok(f"Got: {value}")
    return Result.error(0)

# Run it
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(process_result())
```

With proper editor configuration, you should see:

- Autocomplete when typing `Maybe.` or `Result.`
- No red underline type errors
- Proper type inference for the `value` variable
- Quick documentation on hover

If you see type errors, check that mypy is installed and your virtual environment is activated.

<Callout type="success" title="Ready to Code!">

Your editor is now configured for better-py development. You should have:

- Type checking with mypy that catches errors as you type
- Autocomplete with Pylance/PyCharm that shows available methods
- Code formatting with Ruff that keeps code consistent
- Linting with Ruff that catches code quality issues
- Test discovery with pytest for running tests quickly

These tools work together to make development faster, safer, and more pleasant.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Editor configuration can be finicky. Here are solutions to the most common problems.

### Pylance not showing type errors

If Pylance isn't catching type errors, check three things:

1. **Select the correct interpreter** - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type "Python: Select Interpreter", and choose the virtual environment where you installed better-py

2. **Reload the window** - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type "Developer: Reload Window" to restart VS Code with the new settings

3. **Check the type checking mode** - Verify that `python.analysis.typeCheckingMode` is set to `"basic"` or `"strict"` in your settings

### mypy can't find better-py

If mypy reports import errors for better-py, it's usually a path issue:

1. **Install mypy in the same environment** - Make sure mypy is installed in the virtual environment where better-py is installed:

   ```bash
   pip install mypy
   ```

2. **Create a mypy.ini file** - Add explicit configuration so mypy knows where to look:

   ```ini
   [mypy]
   python_version = 3.11
   strict = true
   explicit_package_bases = true
   ```

3. **Run with explicit package path** - As a workaround, run mypy with the explicit package bases flag:

   ```bash
   mypy --explicit-package-bases your_file.py
   ```

### Ruff not formatting on save

If Ruff isn't formatting your code automatically:

1. **Verify Ruff is installed** - Run `pip list | grep ruff` to confirm it's in your environment

2. **Check the formatter setting** - In VS Code, ensure `"[python]"` has `"editor.defaultFormatter"` set to `"ms-python.black-formatter"` or the Ruff formatter extension

3. **Check format on save** - Verify that `"editor.formatOnSave"` is set to `true` in your settings

### Virtual environment not detected

If your editor doesn't recognize your virtual environment:

1. **Check the activation** - Make sure you've activated the environment in your terminal before launching the editor

2. **Select the interpreter manually** - In VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Python: Select Interpreter" → browse to `.venv/bin/python`

3. **Restart the editor** - Sometimes editors need to be restarted to detect new environments
