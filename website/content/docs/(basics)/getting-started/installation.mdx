import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

Installing better-py is straightforward, but there are several approaches depending on your workflow. This guide will walk you through each option and help you choose the right one for your project.

---

## System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed. better-py takes advantage of modern Python type hints and features that aren't available in earlier versions.

You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If you see a version lower than 3.11, you'll need to upgrade. Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version, or use your system's package manager.

<Callout type="warning" title="Why Python 3.11+?">

better-py uses union syntax (`T | None`) and other type features that were introduced in Python 3.11. While you could technically use older versions with workarounds, the library is designed and tested for modern Python versions.

</Callout>

## Choosing an Installation Method

better-py can be installed with any Python package manager. The right choice depends on your project setup and personal preference.

If you're just getting started or working on a simple project, use pip with a virtual environment. For larger projects or teams, consider uv or Poetry for better dependency management. The core library works the same regardless of how you install it.

---

## Installing with pip

pip is the standard Python package installer and comes pre-installed with Python. It's the simplest option for most users.

First, create a virtual environment to keep your dependencies isolated:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate on macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate on Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Virtual environments prevent package conflicts between projects. When you activate a virtual environment, your terminal uses the Python interpreter and packages installed in that environment instead of the system-wide Python.

Now install better-py:

```bash
pip install better-py-fp
```

That's it. You can now import and use better-py in your project.

---

## Installing with uv

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a modern Python package installer that's significantly faster than pip. It's an excellent choice if you want speed and modern tooling.

First, install uv itself:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then create a new project and install better-py:

```bash
uv init my-project
cd my-project
uv pip install better-py-fp
```

uv manages virtual environments automatically, so you don't need to create one manually. It also handles dependency resolution much faster than pip, which becomes noticeable as your project grows.

---

## Installing with Poetry

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is a full-featured dependency management tool for Python. It handles installation, dependency resolution, and virtual environment management all in one place.

If you don't have Poetry installed:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Create a new project and add better-py:

```bash
poetry new my-project
cd my-project
poetry add better-py-fp
```

Poetry will create a `pyproject.toml` file to track your dependencies and lock exact versions in `poetry.lock`. This ensures your team uses the same versions, which is crucial for reproducible builds.

---

## Installing with pipenv

[pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/) combines pip and virtualenv into a single tool. It automatically creates and manages virtual environments for your projects.

Install pipenv first:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Then set up your project:

```bash
pipenv --python 3.11
pipenv install better-py-fp
```

pipenv creates a `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` to manage dependencies, similar to how Poetry works. Activate your project environment with `pipenv shell` before running Python commands.

---

## Verifying Your Installation

After installing better-py, verify that it works correctly. Create a simple test script to check the core functionality:

```python
# verify_installation.py
from better_py import Maybe, Result, PersistentList

# Test Maybe
maybe_value = Maybe.some(42)
assert maybe_value.is_some() == True
assert maybe_value.unwrap() == 42

# Test Result
result = Result.ok("success")
assert result.is_ok() == True
assert result.unwrap() == "success"

# Test PersistentList
lst = PersistentList.of(1, 2, 3)
assert lst.to_list() == [1, 2, 3]

print("All tests passed! better-py is installed correctly.")
```

Run this script with:

```bash
python verify_installation.py
```

If you see "All tests passed!" then better-py is installed and working correctly. If you get an import error, make sure you've activated the correct virtual environment where you installed better-py.

---

## Development Installation

If you want to contribute to better-py or modify it yourself, you'll need to install it in editable mode. This allows you to make changes to the source code and have them reflected immediately without reinstalling.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Clone the repository

    First, clone the better-py repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nesalia-inc/better-py.git
    cd better-py
    ```

    This creates a local copy of the codebase on your machine.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Install uv for development

    While you can use pip for development, uv is recommended for its speed:

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

    uv will handle dependency installation and virtual environment management.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Install in editable mode

    Install better-py along with all development dependencies:

    ```bash
    uv sync --all-extras
    ```

    This installs better-py in editable mode, meaning changes you make to the source code will be reflected immediately when you run Python code.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Verify the installation

    Run a quick test to make sure everything works:

    ```bash
    uv run python -c "from better_py import Maybe; print(Maybe.some(42))"
    ```

    You should see `Maybe(42)` printed to the terminal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Development Dependencies

better-py itself has no runtime dependencies, but you may want these tools for development:

```bash
# Type checking with mypy
pip install mypy

# Testing with pytest
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Code quality with Ruff
pip install ruff
```

Or install them all at once using the development extras:

```bash
# With pip
pip install better-py-fp[dev]

# With uv
uv pip install better-py-fp --all-extras
```

These tools help you catch bugs early, maintain code quality, and ensure your changes don't break existing functionality.

---

## Using better-py in Docker

For containerized applications, add better-py to your `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Install better-py
RUN pip install better-py-fp --no-cache-dir

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

For production builds, consider a multi-stage setup to reduce the final image size:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim as builder

WORKDIR /app
RUN pip install better-py-fp --user

FROM python:3.11-slim

COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

Multi-stage builds separate the build environment from the runtime environment, resulting in smaller images that don't include build tools or temporary files.

---

## CI/CD Installation

better-py works seamlessly with continuous integration systems. Here are examples for common platforms.

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - run: pip install better-py-fp
      - run: pytest
```

### GitLab CI

```yaml
test:
  image: python:3.11
  script:
    - pip install better-py-fp
    - pytest
```

Both examples install better-py and run tests. You can extend these to include linting, type checking, or deployment steps.

## Upgrading better-py

To upgrade to the latest version of better-py, use the appropriate command for your package manager:

```bash
# pip
pip install --upgrade better-py-fp

# uv
uv pip install better-py-fp --upgrade

# Poetry
poetry update better-py-fp

# pipenv
pipenv update better-py-fp
```

Check the [release notes](https://github.com/nesalia-inc/better-py/releases) for information about new features and breaking changes in each version.

---

## Uninstalling better-py

If you need to remove better-py from your project:

```bash
# pip
pip uninstall better-py-fp

# uv
uv pip uninstall better-py-fp

# Poetry
poetry remove better-py-fp

# pipenv
pipenv uninstall better-py-fp
```

After uninstalling, you may want to remove any unused dependencies as well to keep your environment clean.

## Troubleshooting Installation Issues

Most installations go smoothly, but occasionally you might encounter problems. Here are solutions to common issues.

### Permission errors on Linux or macOS

If you see permission errors during installation, you're likely trying to install to system Python without root access. The solution is to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install better-py-fp
```

Virtual environments don't require root access because they install packages to a directory within your project.

Alternatively, you can install to your user directory:

```bash
pip install --user better-py-fp
```

This installs packages to `~/.local/` which doesn't require special permissions.

### SSL certificate errors

On some systems, especially corporate networks, you might encounter SSL certificate errors when pip tries to connect to PyPI. First, try upgrading pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

If that doesn't work, you can temporarily bypass SSL verification (not recommended for production):

```bash
pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org better-py-fp
```

For a permanent solution, configure your system's SSL certificates or ask your network administrator about proxy settings.

### Proxy server issues

If you're behind a corporate firewall or proxy server, pip might not be able to connect to PyPI. Configure pip to use your proxy:

```bash
pip install --proxy http://user:pass@proxyserver:port better-py-fp
```

You can also set environment variables to avoid typing this repeatedly:

```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=http://user:pass@proxyserver:port
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:pass@proxyserver:port
pip install better-py-fp
```
