title: Pipe & Flow
description: Left-to-right function chaining

## `pipe(value, *functions)`

Pass a value through a sequence of functions, executing left-to-right. Each function receives the output of the previous one. Unlike `compose`, `pipe` executes immediately and returns the final value.

```python
from better_py.functions import pipe

result = pipe(5,
    lambda x: x + 1,  # 6
    lambda x: x * 2   # 12
)
```

The value `5` flows through each transformation. Use `pipe` for one-off transformations where you don't need to reuse the pipeline.

## `flow(*functions)`

Create a reusable pipeline from a sequence of functions. Returns a function that, when called, executes the pipeline on the input.

```python
from better_py.functions import flow

process = flow(
    lambda x: x + 1,
    lambda x: x * 2
)

process(5)   # 12
process(10)  # 22
```

Like `pipe` but returns a function instead of executing immediately. Use `flow` when you need to apply the same transformation to multiple values.

## `Pipeline`

Builder interface for collection operations. Chain methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` before executing on a collection.

```python
from better_py.functions import Pipeline

result = (Pipeline()
    .map(lambda x: x * 2)
    .filter(lambda x: x > 0)
    .execute([1, -2, 3]))  # [2, 6]
```

Each method returns the `Pipeline` object for chaining. Call `execute()` with your collection to run the pipeline.

## Example

Here's a realistic data processing pipeline:

```python
from better_py.functions import pipe

def parse(text):
    return int(text)

def validate(n):
    return n if n > 0 else None

def format(n):
    return f"Value: {n}"

result = pipe("42", parse, validate, format)
```

The input is parsed, validated, then formatted. Each step is isolated and testable.

## Reference

| Function | Purpose | Returns |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `pipe` | One-off transformation | Value |
| `flow` | Reusable pipeline | Function |
| `Pipeline` | Collection operations | Builder |

Use `pipe` for single transformations, `flow` for reusable transformations, and `Pipeline` for working with collections.
