title: Pipe & Flow
description: Left-to-right function chaining and data flow
---

The **pipe** and **flow** utilities enable left-to-right function chaining, transforming how we think about data transformations in Python.

## `pipe(value, *functions)` - Pipe Value Through Functions

Applies functions to a value in left-to-right order: `pipe(x, f, g, h)` equals `h(g(f(x)))`.

```python
from better_py.functions import pipe

add_one = lambda x: x + 1
double = lambda x: x * 2

pipe(5, add_one, double)  # 12
```

Each step transforms the result of the previous one. This is perfect for data processing pipelines:

```python
pipe("data.json",
    read_file,
    parse_json,
    clean_data,
    save_data
)
```

**Use `pipe` when:** You have one-off transformations that need to happen in sequence.

## `flow(*functions)` - Create Reusable Pipeline

Creates a reusable function from a series of functions:

```python
from better_py.functions import flow

add_one = lambda x: x + 1
double = lambda x: x * 2

process = flow(add_one, double)
process(5)  # 12
process(10)  # 22
```

**Use `flow` when:** You need to apply the same transformation to multiple inputs.

## `Pipeline` Class - Fluent API

Provides method chaining for collection operations:

```python
from better_py.functions import Pipeline

result = (Pipeline()
    .map(lambda x: x * 2)
    .filter(lambda x: x > 5)
    .reduce(lambda acc, x: acc + x, 0)
    .execute([1, 2, 3, 4]))
```

## Common Patterns

### Data Processing Pipeline

```python
def process_logs(log_file):
    return pipe(
        log_file,
        read_log_file,
        parse_entries,
        filter_errors,
        aggregate_stats
    )
```

### Reusable Transformer

```python
clean_and_normalize = flow(
    remove_outliers,
    normalize,
    scale_features
)

analyze = flow(load_data, clean_and_normalize, apply_model)
```

## When to Use

- **pipe**: One-off transformations, immediate execution
- **flow**: Reusable pipelines, pass as function
- **Pipeline**: Collection operations, fluent interface
