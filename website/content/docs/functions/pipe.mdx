## `pipe(value, *functions)` - Chain Functions Left-to-Right

Pipe passes a value through a sequence of functions, reading naturally from left to right. Each function receives the output of the previous one.

```python
from better_py.functions import pipe

pipe(5, lambda x: x + 1, lambda x: x * 2)  # 12
```

Equivalent to: `third(second(first(value)))`.

## `flow(*functions)` - Create Reusable Function

Creates a reusable function from a chain of transformations. Like `pipe` but returns a function instead of executing immediately.

```python
from better_py.functions import flow

process = flow(lambda x: x + 1, lambda x: x * 2)
process(5)  # 12
```

## `Pipeline` - Fluent Collection API

Builder pattern for collection operations. Chain map, filter, and other operations before executing on a collection.

```python
from better_py.functions import Pipeline

Pipeline().map(lambda x: x * 2).filter(lambda x: x > 0).execute([1, -2, 3])  # [2, 6]
```

## When to Use

- **pipe**: One-off transformations
- **flow**: Reusable pipelines
- **Pipeline**: Collection operations
