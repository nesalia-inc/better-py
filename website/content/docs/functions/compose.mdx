## `compose(*functions)`

Function composition combines multiple functions into a single function where the output of each function becomes the input of the next. The `compose` function executes right-to-left, following mathematical convention.

```python
from better_py.functions import compose

double = lambda x: x * 2
increment = lambda x: x + 1

transform = compose(double, increment)
transform(5)  # 12: increment(5) → 6, then double(6) → 12
```

Reading from right to left: `increment` runs first on the input, then `double` runs on the result. This creates a reusable transformation pipeline.

## `compose_left(*functions)`

The `compose_left` function works identically to `compose` but executes left-to-right, which can be more intuitive when reading code as a data pipeline.

```python
from better_py.functions import compose_left

transform = compose_left(increment, double)
transform(5)  # 12
```

Here the execution order matches the reading order: `increment` then `double`. Choose between `compose` and `compose_left` based on which direction feels more natural for your use case.

## Example: Validation Pipeline

Composition is particularly useful for validation and data processing chains:

```python
def get_user(id):
    return {"id": id, "role": "admin"}

def check_perms(user):
    return user if user["role"] == "admin" else None

def check_auth(user):
    return user if user else None

validate = compose(check_auth, check_perms, get_user)
result = validate(123)  # Returns user object
```

The data flows through each function: `get_user(123)` fetches the user, `check_perms` verifies admin role, and `check_auth` handles the final validation. Each function is pure and single-responsibility, making the pipeline easy to test and maintain.

## Reference

| Function | Direction | Returns |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `compose` | Right-to-left | Function |
| `compose_left` | Left-to-right | Function |
| `pipe` | Left-to-right | Value |

Use `compose` when you need a reusable function. Use `pipe` when you want to execute a chain immediately on a value.
