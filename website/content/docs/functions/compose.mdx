## `compose(*functions)` - Compose Right-to-Left

Function composition combines multiple functions into a single function. The output of each function becomes the input of the next, executed from right to left (mathematical convention).

```python
from better_py.functions import compose

double = lambda x: x * 2
increment = lambda x: x + 1

transform = compose(double, increment)
transform(5)  # 12: increment runs first, then double
```

## `compose_left(*functions)` - Compose Left-to-Right

Same as compose but reads left-to-right, which can be more intuitive for data pipelines.

```python
from better_py.functions import compose_left

transform = compose_left(increment, double)
transform(5)  # 12: increment runs first, then double
```

## Common Pattern

```python
validate = compose(check_auth, check_perms, get_user)
# Data flows: get_user → check_perms → check_auth
```

## Compose vs Pipe

- **compose**: Returns function → reusable
- **pipe**: Returns value → one-off
