description: Currying and partial application

## `curry(func)`

The `curry` decorator transforms a function with multiple arguments into a series of functions that each accept a single argument. This technique, called currying, enables partial application - you can provide some arguments now and the rest later.

```python
from better_py.functions import curry

@curry
def add(x, y, z):
    return x + y + z

add(1)(2)(3)  # 6 - one argument at a time
add(1, 2)(3)  # 6 - partial application with multiple args
```

In the example above, `add(1)` returns a function waiting for the next argument. This is useful for creating specialized versions of general functions.

## `partial_right(func, *args)`

Unlike `functools.partial` which fixes arguments from the left, `partial_right` fixes arguments from the right side. This is particularly useful when the data you want to process should be the first argument.

```python
from better_py.functions import partial_right

divide_by_2 = partial_right(lambda x, y: x / y, 2)
divide_by_2(10)  # 5
```

Here we create a `divide_by_2` function by fixing the divisor to 2. The remaining argument becomes the dividend, making the function readable and reusable.

## `flip(func)`

The `flip` function reverses the order of the first two arguments. This is helpful when adapting functions for use with `pipe` or `flow`, where the data should come first.

```python
from better_py.functions import flip

subtract_from = flip(lambda x, y: x - y)
subtract_from(10, 3)  # 7 (10 - 3)
```

The original `lambda x, y: x - y` subtracts y from x. After flipping, `subtract_from(10, 3)` becomes `lambda y, x: x - y`, giving us `10 - 3 = 7`.

## Example: API Client

Currying shines when building APIs where certain parameters remain constant across multiple calls:

```python
@curry
def fetch(base_url, endpoint, params):
    return requests.get(f"{base_url}/{endpoint}", params=params)

api = fetch("https://api.example.com")  # Pre-fill base URL
users = api("users", {"limit": 10})
posts = api("posts", {"author": 123})
```

By currying `fetch`, we create an `api` function with the base URL already filled in. Subsequent calls only need the endpoint and parameters, making the code cleaner and avoiding repetition.
