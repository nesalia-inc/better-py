title: Mappable Protocol
description: Objects that can be transformed
---

The `Mappable` protocol represents objects that can be transformed over their contents.

---

## Overview

```python
from better_py.protocols import Mappable

class Container(Mappable):
    def map(self, func):
        return Container([func(x) for x in self.items])
```

---

## Methods

### map(func: Callable) -> Mappable

Transform each element:

```python
result = mappable.map(lambda x: x * 2)
```

---

## Implementing Mappable

```python
from better_py.protocols import Mappable

class MyList(Mappable):
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.items = items
    
    def map(self, func):
        return MyList([func(x) for x in self.items])
```
